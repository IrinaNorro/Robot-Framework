# Robot-Framework
Here you will find my projects using Robot Framework.

### Certificate 2 project - Robocorp course certification
This project was built entirely by me using the requirement specification provided by Robocorp. In this project, I learned how to fetch and save data to the project root folder. Use data to order several items on the web store (GUI built by Roobocorp), save PDFs of each ordered item and their receipts in individual PDF files and finally make a ZIP folder of all PDFs. Also used input data from user and saved data in the vault. Learned to run a robot using Robocorp Assistant.

### Certificate 3 project - Robocorp course certification

This project was builtÂ using the Robocorp tutorial. In this project, I learned how to pass data from source of raw data, modify and filter data and then pass it to (HTTP) API.

I learned how to structure a robot in consume-produce pattern splitting the robot into logical pieces. In this project data is splitted to work items that help to maintain the robot clearly and easily. Also handled exceptions (business and application) using work items and managed work data in Robocorp Control Room.
