# Robot-Framework
Here you will find my projects using Robot Framework.

### Certificate 2 project - Robocorp course certification
This project was build entirely by me using requirement spesification provided by Robocorp. In this project I learned how to fetch and save data to project root folder. Use data to order several items on web store (GUI build by Roobocorp), save PDF of each ordered item and their receipts in individual PDF file and finally make a ZIP folder of all PDFs. Also used input data from user and saved data in vault. Learned to run robot using Robocorp Assistant.

### Certificate 3 project - Robocorp course certification
This project was build using tutorial. In this project I learned how to pass data from source of raw data, modify and filter data and then pass it to (HTTP) API. 

I learned how to structure robot in cocnsume-produce pattern splitting robot into logical pieces. In this project data is splitted to work items that helps to maintain robot clearly and easely. Also handled exceptions (business and application) using work items and managed work data in Robocorp Control Room.
